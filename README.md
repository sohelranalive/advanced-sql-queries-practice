## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

1. Display all students and their phone numbers.  
   If the phone number is `NULL`, show `'Not Provided'` using `COALESCE`.

2. Show all courses ordered by price (highest to lowest) and limit the result to **5 courses**.

3. Display courses for **page 2**, assuming **3 courses per page**, using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

4. Update the price of all courses in the `Programming` category by increasing it **10%**.

5. Delete all enrollment records where `progress_percentage` is `NULL`.

6. Find the **total paid amount per course category** using `GROUP BY`.

7. Show course categories where the **average course price is greater than 60** using `HAVING`.

8. Count how many students are enrolled in each course.

9. Explain what happens if you try to insert an enrollment with a `student_id` that does not exist in the `students` table.

10. Display student full name, course title, and paid amount using an **INNER JOIN**.

11. Display all students and their enrolled courses.  
    Include students who have **not enrolled in any course** using a **LEFT JOIN**.

12. Display all courses and their enrolled students.  
    Include courses that **have no enrollments** using a **RIGHT JOIN**.

13. Display all students and all courses, even if there is **no matching enrollment**, using a **FULL JOIN**.

14. Show the **number of enrollments per year** based on `enrollment_date`.

15. Find the **average progress percentage per course**, ignoring `NULL` values.
